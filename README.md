Na-ovoce.cz Backend
===================

Na ovoce aims to become a web community platform that maps fruit trees, fruit bushes and
herbs in wild and public spaces. At the same time its activities increase awareness
of traditional varieties among the general public and contribute to their retention
in the landscape.

## _This repository is no longer maintained and is preserved for curious passers-by only._ 

Starting 2022-04-21 [Na-ovoce.cz](https://www.na-ovoce.cz/) gave up self-funded custom development
and switched to [Mapotic.com](https://www.mapotic.com/) as a mapping provider.
