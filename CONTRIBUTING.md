## What's itching right now?

There are many things to be done (see [issues](https://github.com/jsmesami/naovoce/issues/)).
Besides that, any advice, recommendation, code review will be appreciated.

Please [contact us](mailto:software@na-ovoce.cz) with any questions.  
You are very welcome to bring your own proposals, we are open to discussion.

## Coding style

If you make pull request, please make sure your code style has some _grace_.

If contributing features that visually affect UI, please minimize styling and leave 
the work to our graphics design peer.

We adhere to [pycodestyle](https://pycodestyle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) 
(formely known as pep8), with some exceptions: line length can be (not too much) longer 
than 79 chars, we prefer 4-space indented hanging indents with closing brace lined up 
under the first character of the line that starts the multi-line construct.

Please take the favored tools into account:  
Python 3, HTML5, Bootstrap 3, Less, CoffeeScript, JQuery

The site should remain mobile friendly, HiDPI ready, supporting moderately new browsers.
